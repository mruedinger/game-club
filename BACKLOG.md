# Game Club Backlog

## Conventions
- Priority: P0 (now), P1 (next), P2 (later)
- Status: todo | doing | done

## P0 (MVP)
- Auth via Google OAuth (invite-only allowlist).
- Public pages: home, games list, current game, previously played.
- Games: submit (auth), remove own submissions (auth), delete others (admin).
- Polls: create (auth), vote (auth, up to 3 choices), close (auth).
- Winner flow: require 2 confirmations to set current game (admin override).
- Admin area: manage members, edit site content, view audit logs.

## P1
- Admin UX polish: bulk member updates, content templates.
- Audit log filters and export.
- Poll history and results pages.

## P2
- External game metadata (cover art, tags, descriptions).
- Time-to-beat, pricing, and historical data.
- Weighted voting options (future).
- User ratings and comments on games.
